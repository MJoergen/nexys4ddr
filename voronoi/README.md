# Voronoi diagram on FPGA

This project will be a tutorial on how to make beautiful Voronoi diagrams on an FPGA.

[**Episode 1**](Episodes/ep01) : Hello World! This will go through the basics of generating a simple and crude Voronoi image.

[**Episode 2**](Episodes/ep02) : The Voronoi point is now moving about, and the image quality is greatly enhanced.

[**Episode 3**](Episodes/ep03) : Several Voronoi points are now in use.
