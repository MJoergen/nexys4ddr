I've found a font I like.

I've downloaded the file ProggyClean.pcf from proggyfonts.net
This is a 8x5 font inside a 13x8 bounding box.

Since the screen resolution is 640x480, this gives 80x36 characters on screen, which is 2880 bytes.
The font file contains 256 characters, and with 16 bytes pr. character (instead of 13), this is 4 kB.

The actual conversion takes place in several steps.
1: Convert from pcf to bdf, using the tool here: https://github.com/ganaware/pcf2bdf
2: Extract the bitmap using: grep -e "^[0-9,A-F][0-9,A-F]$" ProggyClean.bdf > ProggyClean.hex
3: Convert to binary and insert 3 empty lines (from 13 to 16) for each character, using convert.py
