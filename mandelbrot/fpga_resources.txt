The XC7A100T contains the following number of resources:

* 240 DSP's
* 4.8 Mbit Block RAM
* 1.1 Mbit Distributed RAM

The design uses memory with 2^19 entries of 9 bit, i.e. 128 blocks of 36 kbit
BRAM. The FPGA contains 135 of such BRAM's, so that should be possible.

Timing estimates:
Using all 240 DSP's allows a maximum frequency of 57 MHz, i.e. 13.7 GFLOPS.
If we reduce the number to only 64 DSP's then the frequency increases to 141
MHz, i.e. 9.1 GFLOPS.

With all 240 DSP's the bottleneck is the selection of iterator index in
src/dispatcher.vhd. This can perhaps be mitigated by a pipeline structure, by
dividing into 16 groups of 16 iterators.

With only 64 DSP's (and the higher frequency) the bottleneck is the addition
performed after the multiplication in src/iterator.vhd. This can probably be
mitigated by integrating the addition into the DSP itself.
