-- This file contains the implementation of a mouse cursor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  Behavioral description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Mouse position is received from the mouse_controller, horizontal and
-- vertical counters are received from vga_module and if the counters
-- are inside the mouse cursor bounds, then the mouse is sent to the
-- screen.
-- The mouse display module can be also used as an overlay of the VGA 
-- signal, also blanking the VGA screen, if the red_in, green_in, blue_in 
-- and the blank_in signals are used. 
-- In this application the signals mentioned and their corresponding code 
-- lines are commented, therefore the mouse display module only generates 
-- the RGB signals to display the cursor, and the VGA controller decides 
-- whether or not to display the cursor.
-- The mouse cursor is 16x16 pixels and uses 2 colors: white and black. 
-- For the color encoding 2 bits are used to be able to use transparency. 
-- The cursor is stored in a 256X2 bit distributed ram memory. If the current
-- pixel of the mouse is "00" then output color is black, if "01" then is
-- white and if "10" or "11" then the pixel is transparent and the input 
-- R, G and B signals are passed to the output. 
-- In this way, the mouse cursor will not be a 16x16 square, instead will 
-- have an arrow shape.
-- The memory address is composed from the difference of the vga counters
-- and mouse position: xdiff is the difference on 4 bits (because cursor
-- is 16 pixels width) between the horizontal vga counter and the xpos
-- of the mouse. ydiff is the difference on 4 bits (because cursor
-- has 16 pixels in height) between the vertical vga counter and the
-- ypos of the mouse. By concatenating ydiff and xidff (in this order)
-- the memory address of the current pixel is obtained.
-- A distributed memory implementation is forced by the attributes, to save 
-- BRAM resources.
-- If the blank input from the vga_module is active, this means that current
-- pixel is not inside visible screen and color outputs are set to black

-- pixel_clk      - input pin, representing the pixel clock, used
--                - by the vga_controller for the currently used
--                - resolution, generated by a dcm. 25MHz for 640x480,
--                - 40MHz for 800x600 and 108 MHz for 1280x1024. 
--                - This clock is used to read pixels from memory 
--                - and output data on color outputs.
-- xpos           - input pin, 10 bits, from mouse_controller
--                - the x position of the mouse relative to the upper
--                - left corner
-- ypos           - input pin, 10 bits, from mouse_controller
--                - the y position of the mouse relative to the upper
--                - left corner
-- hcount         - input pin, 11 bits, from vga_module
--                - the horizontal counter from the vga_controller
--                - tells the horizontal position of the current pixel
--                - on the screen from left to right.
-- vcount         - input pin, 11 bits, from vga_module
--                - the vertical counter from the vga_controller
--                - tells the vertical position of the currentl pixel
--                - on the screen from top to bottom.
-- red_out        - output pin, 4 bits, to vga hardware module.
--                - red output channel
-- green_out      - output pin, 4 bits, to vga hardware module.
--                - green output channel
-- blue_out       - output pin, 4 bits, to vga hardware module.
--                - blue output channel

------------------- Signals used when the mouse display is in overlay mode

-- blank          - input pin, from vga_module
--                - if active, current pixel is not in visible area,
--                - and color outputs should be set on 0.
-- red_in         - input pin, 4 bits, from effects_layer
--                - red channel input of the image to be displayed
-- green_in       - input pin, 4 bits, from effects_layer
--                - green channel input of the image to be displayed
-- blue_in        - input pin, 4 bits, from effects_layer
--                - blue channel input of the image to be displayed
